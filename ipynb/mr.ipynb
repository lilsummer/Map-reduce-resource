    "## Question 1: top100_words_simple_plain\n",
    "Return a list of the top 100 words in an article text (in no particular order). You will need to write this as two map reduces:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first job is similar to standard wordcount but with a few tweaks. The data provided for wikipedia is in `*.xml.bz2` format.  Mrjob will automatically decompress `bz2`.  We'll deal with the `xml` in the next question. For now, just treat it as text.  A few hints:\n",
    "   - To split the words, use the regular expression \"\\w+\".\n",
    "   - Words are not case sensitive: i.e. \"The\" and \"the\" reference to the same word.  You can use `string.lower()` to get a single case-insenstive canonical version of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The second job will take a collection of pairs `(word, count)` and filter for only the highest 100.  A few notes:\n",
    "    - **Passing parameters:** To make the job more reusable make the job find the largest `n` words where `n` is a parameter obtained via [`get_jobconf_value`](https://pythonhosted.org/mrjob/utils-compat.html).\n",
    "    - **Keeping track of the top n:** We have to keep track of at most the `n` most popular words.  As long as `n` is small, e.g. 100, we can keep track of the *running largest n* in memory wtih a priority-queue. We suggest taking a look at `heapq` ([details](https://docs.python.org/2/library/heapq.html)), part of the Python standard library for this.  It allows you to push elemnets into a list while keeping track of the highest priority element.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "h = []\n",
    "heappush(h, (5, 'write code'))\n",
    "heappush(h, (7, 'release product'))\n",
    "heappush(h, (1, 'write spec'))\n",
    "heappush(h, (3, 'create tests'))\n",
    "heappop(h)  // returns (1, 'write spec')\n",
    "```\n",
    "   \n",
    "       A naive implementation would cost $O(1)$ to insert but $O(n)$ to retrieve.  `heapq` uses a [self-balancing binary search tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-balancing_binary_search_tree) to enable $O(\\log(n))$ insertion and $O(1)$ removal. You may be asked about this data structure on an interview so it is good to get practice with it now.\n",
    "    - **Working across nodes:** To obtain the largest `n`, we need to first obtain the largest n elements per chunk from the mapper, output them to the same key (reducer), and then collect the largest n elements of those in the reducer (**Question:** why does this gaurantee that we have found the largest n over the entire set?)\n",
    "    - **Working within a node:** Given that we are using a priority queue, we will need to first initialize it, then `push` or `pushpop` each record to it, and finally output the top `n` after seeing each record.  For mappers, notice that these three phases correspond nicely to these three functions:\n",
    "        - `mapper_init`\n",
    "        - `mapper`\n",
    "        - `mapper_final`\n",
    "\n",
    "    There are similar functions in the reducer.  Also, while the run method to launch the mapreduce job is a classmethod:\n",
    "        ```python\n",
    "          if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "            MRWordCount.run()\n",
    "        ```\n",
    "     actual instances of our mapreduce are instantiated on the map and reduce nodes.  More precisely, a separate mapper class is instantiated in each map node and a reducer class is instantiated in each reducer node.  This means that the three mapper functions can pass state through `self`, e.g. `self.heap`. Remember that to pass state between the map and reduce phase, you will have to use `yield` in the mapper and read each line in the reducer. (**Question:** Can you pass state between two mappers?)\n",

    "Notice that the words \"page\" and \"text\" make it into the top 100 words in the previous problem.  These are not common English words!  If you look at the xml formatting, you'll realize that these are xml tags.  You should parse the files so that tags like `<page></page>` should not be included in your total, nor should words outside of the tag `<text></text>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "1. Both `xml.etree.elementtree` from the Python stdlib or `lxml.etree` parse xml. `lxml` is significantly faster though and avoids some bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. In order to parse the text, we will have to accumulate a `<page></page>` worth of data and then split the resulting string into words.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Don't forget that the Wikipedia format can have multiple revisions but you only want the latest one.\n",

    "Finally, notice that 'www' and 'http' make it into the list of top 100 words in the previous problem.  These are also not common English words either!  These are clearly from the url in hyperlinks.  Looking at the format of [Wikipedia links](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup#Links_and_URLs) and [citations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Help:Wiki_markup#References_and_citing_sources), you'll notice that they tend to appear within single and double brackets and curly braces.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint**:\n",
    "You can either write a simple parser to eliminate the urls within brackets, angle braces, and curly braces or you can use a package like the colorfully-named [mwparserfromhell](https://github.com/earwig/mwparserfromhell/), which has been provisioned on `mrjob` and supports the convenient helper function `strip_code()` (which is used by the reference solution).\n",

Do this with n-grams of characters, by first calculating the entropy of a single n-gram and then dividing by n to get the per-character entropy. Use n-grams of size 1, 2, 3.

    "\n",
    "Notes:\n",
    "1. Characters are case sensitive.\n",
    "1. Do not use the previous regex `\\w+` to split --- depending on your system configuration, this may only match English characters, which would severely skew entropy estimates for Thai. Be careful about unicode.\n",

    "Instead of analyzing single links, let's look at double links.  That is, pages `A` and `C` that are connected through many pages `B` where there is a link `A -> B -> C` or `C -> B -> A`. Find the list of all pairs `(A, C)` (you can use alphabetical ordering to break symmetry) that have the 100 \"most\" connections (see below for the definition of \"most\").  This should give us a notion that the articles `A` and `C` refer to tightly related concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. This can be thought of as a Matrix Multiplication problem.  If the adjacency matrix is denoted $M$ (where $M_{ij}$ represents the link between $i$ an $j$), we are looking for the highest 100 elements of the matrix $M M$. Note that this doesn't mean constructing matrices is the most efficent way to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Notice that a lot of Category pages (denoted \"Category:.*\") have a high link count and will rank very highly according to this metric.  Wikipedia also has `Talk:` pages, `Help:` pages, and static resource `Files:`.  All such \"non-content\" pages (and there might be more than just this) and links to them should be first filtered out in this analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Some pages have more links than others.  If we just counted the number of double links between pages, we will end up seeing a list of articles with many links, rather than concepts that are tightly connected.\n",
    "\n",
    "   1. One strategy is to weight each link as $\\frac{1}{n}$ where $n$ is the number links on the page.  This way, an article has to spread it's \"influence\" over all $n$ of its links.  However, this can throw off the results if $n$ is small.\n",
    "\n",
    "   2. Instead, try using [Bayesian Smoothing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing) by weighting each link as $\\frac{1}{n+10}$ where 10 sets the \"scale\" in terms of number of links above which a page becomes \"significant\".  The number 10 was somewhat arbitrarily chosen but seems to give reasonably relevant results.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. This means that our \"count\" for a pair A,C will be the products of the two link weights between them, summed up over all their shared connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Again, if there are multiple links from a page to another, have it only count for 1.  This keeps our results from becoming skewed by a single page that references the same page multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You'll need to filter out the cases where A -> B -> A, but just note that the reference solution does this after calculating the link weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. The links and page titles are encoded into utf-8.\n",
